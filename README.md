# Atelier API: Products Services
A Back-End Engineering project to design, stress test and scale a RESTful API for web-scale traffic.
This is 1 of 4 APIs that serve the data for the [Project Atelier e-commerce Client](https://github.com/Redhat2205/FEC).
The Products Services allow all the information about the products for sale to be consumed by hundreds of users simultaneously using NGINx to load balance and ensure requests are completed with low latency.
